This program was written by  Jan Labanowski and JKL Enterprises, Inc.
It is open source. I am uploading it to GitHub for preservation: it
is getting more difficult to find on the web.

I habe merely added this README file, and the compile.sh script.

# Description

Translit is a program to transliterate texts in  different  character
sets.  The  program  converts input character codes (or sequences of
codes) to a different set of output  char- acter  codes  (or
sequences  of  codes).  Intended for transliteration  to/from
phonetic  representation   of foreign  letters  with  Latin  letters
from/to special national codes used for  these  letters.   It
supports simple  matches,  character  lists and flexible matches via
regular  expressions.  The   new   transliteration schemes  are
easily  added by creating simple transli- teration tables. Multiple
character sets are  supported for  input and output. It does not yet
support UNICODE, but some day it will.

# Usage
